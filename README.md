# Course Selection Support (by G3D3)
This simple system was created to help students of the University of Duisburg-Essen find and compare courses of their study program. Students are able to view other students reviews of courses retrieved from a survey that was carried out through May and June of 2019. Therefore the data basis is not exhaustive let alone very huge, but shows the systems potential and is easily expandable.
Based on the assessed data users are able to pick their specific study program and view ratings of corresponding courses on specfic attributs like diffculty, pacing, etc. as well as the average grade or general recommendation. Users are also able to filter for courses based on their exam style, availablity of excercises or bonus points. Users are provided a Top 3 as well as a "show all" ranking of the reviewd courses in their program. Users are also able to inspect courses in detail or compare 2-3 courses of interest directly to each other.
